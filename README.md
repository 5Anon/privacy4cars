##Data Privacy for connected vehicles
Automobile manufacturers are re-inventing themselves and becoming more like software driven companies. Connected vehicles, as these new generations of vehicles are called, collect data by design about the car, driver, ride, and its surroundings. According to AAA, an average connected vehicle could generate 380 TB to 5100 TB of data in just one year while driving 17,600 minutes on average. 

Connected vehicles collect data by design about the vehicle, driver, driving dynamics, and its surroundings. Data collection is not clearly mentioned to the users upon vehicle purchase. To make matters worse, vehicle manufacturers do not easily allow customers the flexibility and control over data collection measures. So, what options do drivers have to protect their privacy? What can vehicle manufacturers do to raise confidence in vehicle owners about the data custody that they have?

This repository contains the library and application that car manufacturers can use to integrate kep privacy compliance options into their cars. Car manufacturers will have the capability to update the anonymization lambdas at anypoint of time.
